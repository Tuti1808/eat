Eat Now is an app to help you decide where to eat.

## Mission
Hereâ€™s to the indecisive ones. The hesitant. The ditherers. The fence-sitters. The donkey between two haystacks. The ones who can never make a decision. 

We built Eat Now for us. We'll help you pick the best restaurant for any occasion. It's that simple.

## Features
* Search restaurants based on location
* Select a preferred time to dine
* View restaurant photos and reviews
* Vote for the restaurant you want to eat

## Getting Started
1. [Download](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/download/) the latest Xcode release.
2. Clone this repository.
3. Add `APIKeys.swift` to `Eat/Services/` following the format [here](./Configs/APIKeys.swift).
4. Build!

## Contributing
Our primary focus when working on this project was to create something we'd use and to learn about iOS development. If you share the same passion for eating and learning, we'd love to have you contribute! Whether you're suggesting new features or filing bug reports, we think the best way to do so is through a Github issue. We can't wait to see what we'll make together!
